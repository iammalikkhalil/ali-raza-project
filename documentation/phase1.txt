### âœ… Phase 1: Problem Definition and Dataset Selection

#### ðŸ“Œ **Objective:**

Optimize school bus routes using AI to minimize total travel time and distance while considering student pickup constraints (e.g., ride time, capacity, and proximity to stops).

#### ðŸŽ¯ **Goals:**

* Minimize total distance and time traveled.
* Reduce average ride time per student.
* Respect constraints: bus capacity, max student ride time, and on-time school arrival.

#### ðŸ“Š **Evaluation Metrics:**

* Total route distance/time
* MAE / RMSE (for travel time predictions)
* Average student walking + ride time

#### ðŸ”’ **Constraints:**

* Bus capacity (e.g., max 40 students)
* Maximum ride duration (e.g., 45 minutes)
* Pickup time windows (e.g., 6:30â€“7:30 AM)
* Walking distance to stop (e.g., â‰¤ 400m)

#### ðŸ“‚ **Selected Dataset:**

**Geolife GPS Trajectory Dataset (Microsoft Research Asia)**

* 17,621 trajectories from 182 users over 5 years (2007â€“2012)
* Densely sampled GPS logs (\~1â€“5 sec or 5â€“10m intervals)
* Covers diverse modes (walk, bus, car, etc.)
* Most data from **Beijing**, ideal for consistent mapping
* Includes transportation mode labels (subset only)

#### ðŸ”§ Notes:

* Useful for simulating student travel behavior and clustering stops.
* Will require filtering to morning commutes and a specific region (e.g., within Beijingâ€™s 5th Ring Road).
